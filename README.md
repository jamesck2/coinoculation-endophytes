# README
This repository contains all the data and code used for Kosmopoulos, Batstone, & Heath (2023).

The `Analysis` directory holds all the intermediate files (`Data`) and R Notebooks (`Scripts`) needed to generate all the `Figures` and `Tables` in the paper:

- `greenhouse_coinoc.csv` contains the raw data generated by the greenhouse experiment, used to create **Figure 2**
- `greenhouse_N_add.csv` contains the raw data generated by the nitrogen-addition experiment, used to create **Figure 3**
- `coinoculation.Rmd` contains all the code to reproduce **Figures 2 & 3**
- `tp_ep.Rdata` contains the saved endpoint measurements after reformatting the data in `greenhouse_coinoc.csv`
- `dada2_deseq2.Rmd` contains all the code to reproduce **Figures 4 & S1**
    - **NOTE:** To fully execute the code to produce these figures and reproduce **Figures 4 & S1**, you must obtain the raw 16S V3-V4 amplicon reads used in this analysis. These files can be found online from the National Center for Biotechnology Information under BioProject ![PRJNAXXXXXXX](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/XXXXXXX). **Alternatively**, if you choose to forego reproducing the initial steps in this workflow (from filtering & trimming raw sequence reads through sequence dereplication) you can load `dadaFs.RDS` and `dadaRs.RDS` to obtain previously generated dada2 objects for these data.
- `dadaFs.RDS`, `dadaRs.RDS` see note above
- `16S_metadata.csv` contains all the metadata for the tissue occupancy experiment used to generate **Figures 4 & S1**

The `controls` directory contains tables and plots used to compare controls vs treatment groups in `greenhouse_coinoc.csv`

The `treated` directory contains tables and plots used to compare inoculation treatments in `greenhouse_coinoc.csv`. It also contains intermediate files used to generate **Figure 2**.

The `Nadd` directory contains tables and plots used to compare nitrogen-addition groups in `greenhouse_N_add.csv`. It also contains intermediate files used to generate **Figure 3**.

The `16S` directory contains intermediate files, test results, and plots used in the analysis of the 16S amplicon data used to generate **Figures 4 & S1**. Within, there is `ASV.fasta` which is a fasta-formatted file of the ASV inferred from the amplicon data.
